docker swarm 

  we need to setup 1 master node and 2 worker node
  like we need install all 3 node docker service with locally connected.
  we need to stop firewall service in master node

  then we need to start docker swarm init
  docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.18.5
  this will work as a master and it will genrate token for worker node 
  we need to copy that all worker nodes then all the node connected each other.
  Ex : Token Id: 
   docker swarm join     --token SWMTKN-1-1k07pucckd5pkbqopfio61gumcq9cqy5tswbfcokqp24qm2bif-8z7z2i25sf3x4mk7n74nrdwzs     192.168.18.5:2377
we need to check worker nodes in master 
  docker node ls
  it will all nodes and it will show leader node but this will work in master node cmd

-- how to create service in docker
  docker service create --name "MyJenkinsServer" -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins
  how to check servioce
  docker service ls
  to see the perticular serive details
  docker service ps Myjenkinserver(service name)

  how to put master node drain state (means any job submiited it wont run inthe master node)
 docker node update --availability drain master2
if need that drain node in active state use instaed of drain --> Active
  the againthis node will come back as a active.
 how to remove  the serice command is 
  docker service rm Myjenkinsserver(Serivce name)
-- 
  how to run serive at a time two node using replica 
  docker service create --name "MyJenkinsServer" --replicas=2 -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins
   here any one server gone down automatically start another node serive running.

  --how to scale service 
  docker service scale MyJenkinsServer=5
  here the service should run at a time nodes it scale availablity.
  this perfect example of the load balancer.

  how to leave in node in docker swarm
  docker swarm node leave
  this command will remove node from master it will show the down.
